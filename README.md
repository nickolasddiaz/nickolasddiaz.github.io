# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```sh
bun run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
